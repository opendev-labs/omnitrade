# Operator Manual

**Welcome, Operator.**
This guide details the daily workflow to operate the Omnitrade Zero-Cost System.

## Daily Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Market Scan
1.  **Open Google Sheets**: Navigate to your configured "Core Engine" sheet.
2.  **Update Market State**:
    *   Check `TF` (Timeframe) and `Volatility` in the `MARKET_STATE` tab.
    *   Ensure data sources (TradingView/CoinGecko) match the sheet values.
3.  **Governance Check**:
    *   Review the `HEALTH_SCORE`. If < 60, consider reducing size.
    *   **CRITICAL**: If Health < 40, the system will not trade.

### Phase 2: System Ignition
1.  **Launch Terminal**: Open the Omnitrade Webapp (`omnitrading.vercel.app`).
2.  **Verify Sync**: Check the "Health Circle" on the dashboard. It should match your Sheet.
3.  **Activate Bots**:
    *   Go to the **Fleet Management** view.
    *   Select bots aligned with the current regime (e.g., *Trend Pullback* if trending).
    *   Click **INITIALIZE**.

### Phase 3: Intraday Management
*   **Monitoring**: detailed logs are pushed to the main dashboard.
*   **Alerts**: Keep TradingView open for the visual alerts (generated by our Pine Script).
*   **Emergency Stop**: To kill all bots instantly, change the `HEALTH_SCORE` calculation in Sheets to output `0`. The backend will pick this up and lock all execution.

## Troubleshooting

**"Bots won't start?"**
*   Check Health Score: Is it < 40?
*   Check Permission Matrix: Is the specific bot explicitly set to `FALSE` in the sheet?

**"Data mismatch?"**
*   Verify the Service Account connection in Settings.
